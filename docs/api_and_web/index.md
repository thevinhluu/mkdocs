# API and Web Development

Web development involves building websites and applications by combining frontend UI, backend logic, and databases. APIs are the fundamental building blocks that enable these components to communicate effectively.

APIs provide standardized protocols for data exchange between different parts of web applications. Using technologies like REST and GraphQL, APIs allow integration of services, database operations, and interactive features while keeping system components cleanly separated.

This section will guide you through the basics of HTTP, REST API design, gRPC, and WebSockets, providing examples and best practices for modern web development.
